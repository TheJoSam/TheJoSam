# Certificates
I am a Certified Developer,
this is a complete list of them with DOC (Document of Completion) and direct link.

This Libary will grow over time and I have many other Courses currently.

> [!NOTE]
> Certificates cannot be fully categorized as they sometimes flow into each other or are Certificates of a Programming Language
> This makes categorizing harder and is not always possible so please look at all Certificates as I will list them only one time.
